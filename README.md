# cops-and-robbers-spex

Hi, this is the program I wrote when I was attending YSU in the data structure class, the program uses the graham scan algorithm to identify two convex hulls, one for police and one for the criminal
, then, we will import some random coordinates to presents innocent people, if the people are in the criminal hull, the people are in danger, if they are in the police hull,
they are safe. Note: The coordinates of this program are provided in fractions.
